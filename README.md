# House Price Predictor

Small exploratory project focused on understanding how different housing attributes influence market prices. The work lives primarily in `mini-project.ipynb`, where data is cleaned, visualized, and modeled to predict selling price.

## Why this project?
- Practice the full data-science loop on a realistic but manageable dataset.
- Build intuition about which housing features carry the most predictive signal.
- Create a foundation for a future API or UI that could surface quick price estimates.

## Data
The raw data currently lives at `public/Housing.csv`. Initial analysis handles basic cleaning (missing values, categorical encoding) directly in the notebook.

## Notebook workflow
1. Open `mini-project.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Step through the exploration, feature engineering, and modeling cells.
3. Adjust hyperparameters or add new models as needed to compare performance.

## Next steps
- Convert the notebook insights into reusable Python scripts or a lightweight API.
- Add automated tests/validation around the data-prep steps.
- Experiment with richer models (e.g., gradient boosting, neural nets) once the baseline is solid.
